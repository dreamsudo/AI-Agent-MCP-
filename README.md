This project builds a secure, multi layer MCP pipeline that sits between LLMs and external tools (databases, filesystems, APIs). All requests are routed through segmented, crypto protected servers with TLS, optional AES encryption, encrypted logging, and a monitoring tap (“Puerta”), with future work adding semantic security checks.
